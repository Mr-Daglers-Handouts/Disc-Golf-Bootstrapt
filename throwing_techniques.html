         <h2>Common Throwing Techniques</h2>
         <p>Now it is time for you to learn how to throw a disc. This Webpage will show you how to drive using backhand and sidearm as well as two putting methods. You will also learn how to get more distance using the x-step.</p>

      <h3>Getting a Grip</h3>
      <p>Before you can throw a disc correctly you need to grip it properly. For putting, most players use the fan grip. The most common grip for back-hand is the power grip. The sidearm throw requires a completely different grip. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu8gpBd_jnk&feature=youtu.be">This</a> is a video with several professionals talking about how to grip a disc for a back-hand throw. Watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bflFLlFIoM8">video</a> to learn about sidearm grips.</p>
      <h3>Putting</h3>
      <p>The two most common putting styles are the push putt and the spin putt. The push putt (which is the one that I use most) requires a good amout of weight transfer, and most people bring the disc from low to high when using this method. An advantage to this method is that a missed putt typically lands close to the basket. Some disadvantages to the push putt are that it's heavily affected by the wind, and often requires a higher flight path which could hit low-hanging obstacles. </p>
      <p>The spin putt requires a big snap using the player's wrist and arm. The flight path of a spin putt is lower than a push putt and very straight. Because of this, it's less affected by the wind and low-hanging obstacles. One disadvantage of the spin putt is that when missed, it can end up farther away from the basket. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icTf7ht49kE">Here</a> is a tutorial on the push and spin putt.</p>
      <h3>Driving with Back-Hand with X-Step</h3>
      <p>The back-hand throw will give you the most distance. This technique requires you to use the x-step to get your body into the best position to put maximum force on a disc. The disc will tend to fade to the right towards the end of the flight when thrown back-hand. One of the disadvantages to this technique is that it requires you to take your eye off of the target for part of the throw. <a href="https://discgolf.ultiworld.com/2017/03/28/tuesday-tips-breaking-backhand/">Here</a> is a good website breaking down this throw. A good instructional video for the backhand throw can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCs5u9ecVis">here</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>Driving using the Sidearm Technique</h3>
      <p>The disc golf throwing technique nicknamed, ‘sidearm’, ‘forehand’, ‘flick’ and ‘two-finger’ is the primary (or only) driving method for some players, a useful tool for others, and an enigma for many (Personally I fall into the second group). One thing that I like about the sidearm, is that you can keep your eye on the target durning the entire throw. This throwing technique puts an opposite spin on the disc compared to the back-hand, which will cause the disc to turn to the right towards the end of the flight when thrown by a right-handed player. <a href="https://allthingsdiscgolf.com/throw-sidearm-breakdown-basics/">Here</a> is a good website that breaks down the sidearm technique. You can also find a good instructional video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7ewCoZ8BwM">here</a>.</p>
