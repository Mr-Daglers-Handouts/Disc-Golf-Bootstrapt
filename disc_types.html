         <h2>Plastics and Disc Types</h2>
         <p>Here you will learn about the different plastic types and the advantages and disadvantages of each. We will read about the four main disc types: putter, midrange, fairway drive, and distance drive. Flight characteristics will also be covered.</p>

      <h3>Manufacturers</h3>
      <p>For several years there were only two main disc golf manufacturers: <a href="https://www.innovadiscs.com/">Innova</a> and <a href="https://www.discraft.com/">Discraft</a>. With the growth of the sport, several manufacturers have surfaced including: <a href="https://www.discmania.net/">Discmania</a>, <a href="https://www.dynamicdiscs.com/">Dynamic Discs</a>, <a href="http://www.latitude64.se/">Latitude 64</a>, and <a href="https://www.prodigydisc.com/">Prodigy</a>. There are a few other companies, but most players will be throwing discs made from the ones listed. </p>

      <h3>Disc Types</h3>
      <p>Each disc golf manufacturer makes four types of discs. The putter and approach disc is used for short shots and putting, which is when you throw the disc into the target or basket. Midrange discs are close to putters because they seem to fly slow, are fairly easy to control, and land with minimal skipping. Midranges differ from putters because they will fly farther and are not meant to be caught by the basket. Unlike putters and midrange discs that have a blunt edge like a frisbee, fairway and distance drivers have a sharper edge to help them cut through the air and fly much farther.</p>

      <h3>Flight Ratings</h3>
      <p>The Innova Flight Ratings System was designed as a way to describe a disc's intended flight. Flight Ratings are divided into four main categories: Speed, Glide, Turn, & Fade. These characteristics can be used to rate various aspects of each disc’s flight. Each disc has a distinct "personality"; or flight path that makes that specific disc unique. Flight Ratings can be used to compare Innova golf discs to each other. Other companies have adopted a similar system, but it’s important to note that flight ratings shouldn’t be used to compare discs between brands since each company rates discs differently. We have over 90 disc models to satisfy a wide range of players and throwing techniques. To learn more about what each of these characteristics, refer to the descriptions below. </p>
      <p class="my_padding"><strong>Speed: </strong>Speed is the rate at which a disc can travel through the air. Faster discs cut into the wind with less effort and are best when throwing upwind. Slower discs take more power to throw upwind, but they’re easier to throw more accurately and may go farther downwind. High-speed discs are not recommended for beginners since they require more power to fly properly.</p>
      <p class="my_padding"><strong>Glide: </strong>Glide describes a disc's ability to maintain loft during flight. Discs with more glide are meant for producing maximum distance and are best for new players. Beginners wanting more distance should choose discs with more glide. Discs with less glide are more accurate in high wind situations.</p>
      <p class="my_padding"><strong>Turn: </strong>High Speed Turn is the tendency for a disc to turn over or bank to the right (for right hand back hand throws) during the initial part of the flight. A disc with a +1 rating is most resistant to turning over, while a -5 rating will turn the most. Discs rated -3 to -5 make good roller discs. Discs with less turn are more accurate in the wind. Discs with more turn are easier to throw for beginners.</p>
      <p class="my_padding"><strong>Fade: </strong>Low Speed Fade is the disc's tendency to hook left (for right hand back hand throws) at the end of the flight. Fade is rated from 0 to 5. A disc rated 0 will finish straightest, while a disc rated 5 will hook hard at the end of the flight. High fade discs are usually used for Spike and Skip shots.</p>

      <h3>Plastic Types</h3>
      <p>There are several plastic types that differ in durability, grip, and flexibility. For more information, watch these two videos: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzxROa5x3vQ">video 1</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By0CFQwVUT0">video 2</a>. The weight of a disc can also affect its flight. For the most part, the faster you throw a disc, the heavier you would want the disc to be.
